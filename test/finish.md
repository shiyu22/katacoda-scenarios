This demo shows a system about molecular similarity search with Milvus. You can also use your own SMILES data.

We have built the demo system (https://milvus.io/scenarios), and we also have an open source projects on substructure and superstructure search in [MolSearch](https://github.com/zilliztech/MolSearch), so you are welcome to try it yourself and search your own molecular.
